# Harvey Sidecars

This project builds the necessary executables as sidecars to distribute along with the [Harvey app](https://github.com/Ethnomethodology/harvey). 

Harvey is a desktop transcription application that uses [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for transcription and [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) for manipulating media formats.
