This project builds the necessary executables as sidecars to distribute along with the Harvey app (https://github.com/Ethnomethodology/harvey). Harvey is a desktop transcription app that uses whisper.cpp for transcription (https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 for diarization (https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1), and ffmpeg (https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) for manipulating media formats.
